# Simpsons Quotes App

This is a simple React application that displays random quotes from The Simpsons TV show. The app features a fading animation for the quotes and fetches new quotes every 10 seconds. It uses the [simpsons-quotes API](https://simpsons-quotes-ten.vercel.app/) to get random quotes.
